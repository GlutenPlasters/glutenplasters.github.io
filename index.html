            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, I'm Andrew! I'm a passionate developer exploring the intersection of natural landscapes and technological innovation. My work blends organic inspiration with cutting-edge digital experiences. I posses blend of self-starter attitude (I am a self-taught developer!) and 3 years professional gameplay programming and software development experience in Unity and Xcode. I am unique in that I have a mixed education comprising of a lifetime of language arts (Ancient Greek, German, published poetry, etc.) and professional teaching experience that I think is a perfect fit for the right company. I am currently seeking employment in at an in-house studio who are geared toward creating games that leverage my expertise in building UI, creating ML Agents, inventing intelligent environments, crafting highly dynamic dialogue-based gameplay systems, and prototyping fascinating and new user experiences that tell a story. </p>

                <p>Fight (Mouse click) your way around the map and collect coins and get to the door! A simplistic combat platformer which I created as an early experiment with ML Agents within Unity. The enemies are ML Agents.</p>
