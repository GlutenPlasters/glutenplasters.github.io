                <p>
                    I want to make new mechanics. For as much as I enjoy making video games, I find myself struggling to play touch and click games (especially mobile games where advanced mechanics are diluted into tap and wait mechanics).
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, I have forced myself to think of something new. I asked myself, how could I create a new inventory system? I love words, and I think text-based interfaced are very powerful, especially if powered by a combination of REGEX, LINQ and NLP. So, that's where my idea was born. Below is my progress.
                </p>

            <section id="more-data">
                <h3>More Data to Interact with</h3>
                <p>So far, the basic mechanism of the commandline works. It can issue commands to the `InteractionDispatch`, which will return data that can be drawn on the HUD.</p>
                <p>There is an issue, however. Currently, there is no intrinsic data stored within the NPCs nor the items. Right now, getting a reference to an NPC or an interaction item is similar to being handed a piece of blank paper and being told that it's an apple. There is no data attached to it for the player to work with. All of this means that there is no discovery. So, I need to make some properties, create some classes that can be passed around simply and easily, and, finally, do something with these data.</p>
                <p>To re-iterate, the whole point of the idea is to create a text-based adventure mechanism on top of a 3D RPG. Thinking about traditional text-based adventures, I've come up with a few commands - 
                    "examine", "inspect", "look at", 
                    "use", "interact with",
                    "pick up", "grab", "take",
                    "drop", "discard"
                What is the point of this mechanic if I could go over to an object, point at it with my player controller and press E to pick it up? Going about it via a text command prompt seems like alot more work and in the end it would end up entailing pressing tab to cycle through the command options, which whould very quickly worse than clicking the mouse button. 
                </p>
                <p>Some solutions could be similar to using the army command hot keys that are in Mount & Blade game series. For example, the digits will select different parts of the army, and the F keys will command your army to do differen things, like charge, or organize themselves into a skien formation, then charge, or wait, or hold their fire, etc.</p>
                <p>Perhaps, players could use a hot key to program their favorite and most useful commands into their quick access (similar to placing items from a chest into your backpack so that they can be used at a moment's notice.</p>
                <p>So this means that some data needs to represent something simiar to an 'isFavorited' property.</p>

                <h3>NPC AI + Grammar/Command Parser</h3>
                <p>The "Shout and Sense" commands parser example <a href="videos">video above</a> shows how words can control actions in game. Currenlty, these are input by the player, but I envision these commands to be input by the NPCs themselves.</p>
                <h4>Introducing Grammar based AI!</h4>
                <p>What if our NPCs had thoughts? What if they went around the world thinking thoughts and then doing actions based on those thoughts? And what if those NPCs learned from their thoughts and chose to tweak their thoughts and learn from the world around them in order to grow into themselves?
                </p>
                <p>That is the mechanic that I am looking at building in this tech demo. It has envolved from the input command line mechanic.<a href="cl-mechanic-future">(More on the future of that below.)</a></p>
                <h5>Grammar</h5>
                <p>When we think of video games, few people think of grammar. I do, however! Grammar is the logic that keeps our society working. It creates a logic that we share or we disagree with. More than languages sounding different, each language comes with their own grammar. There are similarities, however, between most languages.</p>
                <h6>V-DO-(P)-IO</h6>
                <p>Verb - Direct Object - (Preposition) - Indirect Object</p>
                <p>This classic english structure is most common in commands. The verb takes first position and it also takes the indicative mood.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Brush your teeth!</li>
                    <li>"Pick that up</li>
                    <li>"Open your backpack</li>
                    <li>"Talk to him</li>
                    <li>"Drop the sword</li>
                    <li>etc.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If our brain sent audible messages to our muscles, the grammar of it would be in this format. So why not let the NPCs talk to themselves in this format? And from there they can explore the world in thought first, then aciton.
                </p> 
                <h6>Real thoughts, or just numbers?</h6>
                <p>It could be argued that the words would simply boil down to indicies in an array of possible verbs and available objects. This is due to how data works in a computer and it's most likely going to be boiled down to numbers. However, there is hope that, like with robots, thinking of words can be simulated by thinking in numbers.</p>
                <h6>Simulating and NN</h6>
                <p>On the note of simulation, I think that full-fledged Neural Networks are a bit overkill for most games. Also, it is difficult to control the accuracy and relevancy of the output in a fictional world. </p>

                <h3>The future of the Command Line Mechanic</h3>
                <p>The direct evolution of the command line mechanic seems to have gone in the way of NPC AI. However, I do think there are still some practical uses for it in the player's hands. Let's look more deeping in to that and brainstorm some more ideas.</p>
