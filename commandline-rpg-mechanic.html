                    I want to make new mechanics. For as much as I enjoy making video games, I find myself struggling to play touch and click games (especially mobile games where advanced mechanics are diluted into tap and wait mechanics).

                    So, I have forced myself to think of something new. I asked myself, how could I create a new inventory system? I love words, and I think text-based interfaced are very powerful, especially if powered by a combination of REGEX, LINQ and NLP. So, that's where my idea was born. Below is my progress.
